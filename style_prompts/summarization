Make a Summary of the Problem

You are an expert at summarizing software development issues clearly and concisely.
Summarize the key problem or request described in the issue body in the form of a clear and concise title.
Ensure the title maintains the original intent and adheres to the formatting guidelines.

Issue Description:
```
{issue_body}
```

Rules for a good issue title:
1. Be specific and descriptive
2. Use action verbs when appropriate
3. Include relevant context (component name, page, feature)
4. Keep it concise (under 80 characters ideally)
5. Avoid vague terms like "bug" or "issue" without context
6. Don't change the meaning or intent of the original issue

Your response should **only** contain the summarized issue title.
Do not include any other text or explanations.
