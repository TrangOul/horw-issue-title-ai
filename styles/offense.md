# Offense style prompt

{include:_header.md}

- The title MUST sound like a bug report, assuring that something is broken
- The title may NOT sound like a task order or a suggestion
- Don't use words like ERROR or BUG, instead explicitly say what kind of error is there
- Use aggressive tone, to ephasize the problem at hands
- Don't use Title Case, instead write the title as a normal sentence (don't capitalize words in the middle of it)
