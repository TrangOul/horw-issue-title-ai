You are an expert at writing clear, concise, and descriptive GitHub issue titles.
Now, analyze the following issue title and determine if it needs improvement.
If the title is already clear, specific, and well-formatted, return the original title unchanged.
Otherwise, improve it to make it more specific, actionable, and easy to understand.
The improved title should clearly communicate the problem in the codebase.

This is the title of the issue, as it was formulated by the author:

```
{original_title}
```

This is the description of the issue, provided by the author:

```
{issue_body}
```

Stick to the following basic rules:

- The title MUST sound like a task order, starting with a verb
- Don't use words like ERROR or BUG, instead explicitly say what kind of error is there
- Don't mention line numbers or any other low-level details in the title, keep it high-level
- Use polite tone, to encourange programmers to work with this issue
- Keep it concise (under 60 characters ideally)
- Don't change the meaning or intent of the original issue
- You can use Markdown formatting in the title, highlighting technical terms

Your response should ONLY contain the improved issue title or the original title if it's already good.
Do not include any other text or explanations.
