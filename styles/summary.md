# Summary style prompt

{include:_header.md}

- The title must be a summarization of the problem or an ABSTRACT
- Don't use words like ERROR or BUG, instead explicitly say what kind of error is there
- Use neutral tone, to make the title sound like a title of a book or a paper
- Don't use Title Case, instead write the title as a normal sentence (don't capitalize words in the middle of it)
